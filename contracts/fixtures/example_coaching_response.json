  "summary": "You delivered a well-structured 3-minute practice session with clear pacing. Your main opportunity is reducing filler words, which appeared 4.2 times per minute—mostly during transitions between your main points.",

      "area": "pace",
      "observation": "Your 165 WPM speaking rate is within the optimal range, making you easy to follow without feeling rushed"

    "observation": "You used filler words 4.2 times per minute, primarily 'um' when transitioning between ideas at 12.5s and 89.2s",
    "impact": "Replacing fillers with brief pauses will make you sound more confident and polished"

  "recommended_drills": [
    {
      "drill_id": "drill_fluency_silence",
      "reason": "Your filler patterns suggest you're using 'um' to hold the floor—this drill trains you to embrace silence instead",

      "drill_id": "drill_clarity_power_pause",
      "reason": "You already use power pauses effectively (3 detected)—building on this strength will naturally reduce fillers",
